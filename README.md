#### Suggestions 
If you want to suggest any important/interesting methods/problems not mentioned here or report any mistakes in my taxonomy, you can submit an issue on my [GitHub repo](https://github.com/kdkalvik/machine-learning-taxonomy).

#### Make Your Own Taxonomy 
You can make your own version of this page to document the taxonomy of something else by forking this [GitHub repo](https://github.com/kdkalvik/machine-learning-taxonomy) and updating the file **topology.csv** with your own taxonomy.

#### Disclaimer
The taxonomy presented here is from my understanding of the topics and might not necessarily represent the correct taxonomy. It is also impossible to describe the relationship between all the methods mentioned here as a directed acyclic graph tree. The taxonomy here is merely one realization of what makes the most sense to me, given my interests and knowledge.
